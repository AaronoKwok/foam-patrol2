# Foam-Patrol 

## Overview

Foam Patrol is a site I created to connect people who enjoy the sport of surfing or want to get into it. It hosts surf forecasts, surf trips, and paths to surf tutorials. The site is inspired by websites like [Barefoot Surf](https://barefootsurftravel.com/) and [Magic Seaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/). ðŸ¤™
