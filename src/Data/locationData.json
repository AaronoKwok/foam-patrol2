All the energy pulsing around Lighthouse Point mellows out by the time it gets to Cowell's, and the result is a long, gentle, easy wave that breaks for a very long time. Cowell's is one of the most crowded surf spots in Santa Cruz, but as most of the surfers are beginners, there is little animosity. Most of the people at Cowell's are there to learn and have fun and have a good time. Mixed in with all the learners and Banana Slugs and other flotsam and jetsam is a cadre of red-hot longboarders who can score major tip time from the staircase all the way to the beach.",

Because Santa Cruz faces straight south, Lighthouse Point points almost directly south, and that weird geography is the secret to Steamer Lane’s success. Swells from the west and northwest that ravage the coast north of Santa Cruz are evened out and groomed as they bend into the Monterey Bay. The same is true for the northwest winds that pound the north coast for most of the year. Because of the bend at the top of the Monterey Bay, those northwest winds blow offshore at Steamer Lane. There are few things in nature as beautiful as a 10-foot, offshore peak unloading at Steamer Lane. Steamer Lane is maybe a little too irresistible, because it is now one of the most crowded surf spots in California. At any given hour, there is probably a wider range of people surfing Steamer Lane than anywhere in the world.",

Because this place is somewhat protected from swell and wind, it is mostly a beginner to intermediate wave. Linda Mar has its epic days, but for the most part, the surf ranges from poor to so-so, and the water is crowded with beginners and intermediate surfers. 'It's the poor person's Cowell's,' as one local surfer described it. Linda Mar has a reputation for being gray and gloomy, but even in the thick of the region's summer fog season, there's often an inexplicable donut of sunshine beating down on the place. Linda Mar is at the end of a big valley that funnels south and southwest winds into offshores, and the surf can be cranking there during the winter, when the rest of the coast is blown out. The same condition can exist in the summer, when that valley will turn the onshore fog winds into offshores. Linda Mar can be sunny and nice when Ocean Beach is like Moscow in winter. From north to south, the first spot at Linda Mar is called Round House. Next is Wander Inn, named for a bar that thrived in the '60s. South of Wander Inn, there is a parking lot and showers. This area is called State Park or the Pump House. South of that is The Creek, where a small, possibly toxic creek comes out to sea. At the south end of Linda Mar, The Boat Docks are lefts that break along the point in front of Dick Keating's timeless house.",

During the winter, solid WNW swells continue to offer bowled-up rights into the Pier, while the left is a mixed bag of closeouts and open sections. The surf is serviceable most every day of the year, and as such, the Northside has ample crowd. While the Southside is typically filled with any number of traveling pros getting ready for the next contest, the Northside often entertains a saltier crowd. Up the beach gets great on combo swells, while the pier bowl is the best show this side of the pier on the daily.",

While Waikiki conjures images of small, soft, rolling waves, when there's a solid Southern Hemi swell running, many of its breaks turn on enough to keep the beginners on the inside, leaving the better outside rollers for more experienced surfers.",
